# 📊 Adventure Works – Sales Analysis Project

## 🔍 About the Project

This project presents an end-to-end business analysis based on the Adventure Works sales data. The goal was to derive actionable insights that help evaluate sales performance, identify improvement opportunities, and support strategic decisions.

The project includes all key stages of a typical data analysis workflow – from planning and data modeling to dashboard creation and executive presentation.

## 🧩 Project Workflow

1. **Project Scoping**  
   Defined the business goals, analytical questions, and project scope in a dedicated scope document.

2. **Data Modeling**  
   Built an ERD (Entity-Relationship Diagram) to define the logical structure of the data model.

3. **Data Cleaning**  
   Cleaned and transformed the raw CSV files using Power Query. 

4. **Exploratory Analysis**  
   Performed descriptive statistics, DAX measures, trend analysis, and KPI calculations in Excel (Power Pivot, PivotTables).

5. **Dashboard Design**  
   Created a functional spec and then designed two [Tableau dashboards:](https://public.tableau.com/views/Adventure_Works_17511047622390/YearStatsDashboard?:language=en-US&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)
