# 📊 Adventure Works – Sales Analysis Project

## 🔍 About the Project

This project presents an end-to-end business analysis based on the Adventure Works sales data. The goal was to derive actionable insights that help evaluate sales performance, identify improvement opportunities, and support strategic decisions.
